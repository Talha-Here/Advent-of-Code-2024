Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used to match patterns in strings. They work by defining a search pattern using a combination of literal characters and special symbols, allowing you to locate, extract, replace, or validate text based on complex rules.

### **Key Concepts of Regex**

1. **Literal Characters**:
   - These match themselves directly in the text.
   - Example: The pattern `hello` matches the string `"hello"`.

2. **Metacharacters (Special Symbols)**:
   - Symbols with special meanings to create more dynamic patterns.
   - Example:
     - `.` matches any single character except a newline.
     - `^` matches the start of a string.
     - `$` matches the end of a string.
     - `*`, `+`, `?`, `{}` control repetitions.

3. **Character Classes**:
   - Define sets of characters to match.
   - `[abc]` matches any one of `a`, `b`, or `c`.
   - `\d` matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
   - `\w` matches any word character (letters, digits, underscores).

4. **Quantifiers**:
   - Specify how many times a pattern should repeat.
   - `*` matches 0 or more times.
   - `+` matches 1 or more times.
   - `{n,m}` matches between `n` and `m` times.

5. **Groups and Capturing**:
   - Parentheses `()` are used to group patterns and capture matched substrings.
   - Example: `(ab)+` matches `ab`, `abab`, `ababab`.

6. **Escaping Special Characters**:
   - Use a backslash `\` to match literal metacharacters.
   - Example: `\.` matches a period `.`.

### **How Regex Works**
Regex engines process the pattern and string step by step, evaluating whether the pattern matches the string.

1. **Pattern Compilation**:
   - The regex is converted into an internal representation for efficient processing.

2. **Pattern Matching**:
   - The engine starts at the beginning of the string and checks if the pattern matches.
   - It can match greedily (the longest possible match) or lazily (the shortest match).

3. **Result Return**:
   - If a match is found, the engine returns the matched text or groups.
   - If not, it returns `None` or indicates failure.

### **Examples**

#### **Match a Pattern**
```python
import re
text = "hello123"
pattern = r"hello\d+"  # 'hello' followed by one or more digits
match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print("Matched:", match.group(0))
```
**Output**:
```
Matched: hello123
```

#### **Extract Multiple Matches**
```python
text = "email: test@example.com, support@company.org"
pattern = r"\w+@\w+\.\w+"
emails = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(emails)
```
**Output**:
```
['test@example.com', 'support@company.org']
```

#### **Replace Matches**
```python
text = "The price is $5.00."
pattern = r"\$\d+\.\d{2}"  # Match dollar amounts
result = re.sub(pattern, "[PRICE]", text)
print(result)
```
**Output**:
```
The price is [PRICE].
```

### **Regex Features**

#### **Anchors**
- `^`: Start of a string.
- `$`: End of a string.
- Example: `^hello` matches strings starting with `hello`.

#### **Lookaheads and Lookbehinds**
- Allow matching patterns based on context before or after a match, without including them in the match.
- Example: `(?<=\$)\d+` matches digits preceded by `$`.

#### **Flags**
- Modify the behavior of regex matching.
- Example: `re.IGNORECASE` makes the search case-insensitive.

### **Applications of Regex**
1. **Validation**:
   - Ensure input matches a required format (e.g., email, phone number).
2. **Searching**:
   - Find specific text patterns in large datasets.
3. **Text Processing**:
   - Extract, replace, or split text based on patterns.
4. **Data Parsing**:
   - Process logs, files, or network data.

Regex is widely used in text editors, programming languages, and command-line tools. While it can appear complex, mastering regex provides a robust toolkit for text manipulation tasks.
